💻 Bitwise Operators

🎯 Aim

To perform bitwise operations and demonstrate how to set and reset a specific bit in an integer.

📚 Theory

🔹 Bitwise operators operate directly on the binary representation of integers. They are essential for tasks like flag manipulation, low-level programming, and performance optimization.

🔹 Bitwise AND (&) sets each bit to 1 only if both corresponding bits are 1.
👉 Example: 5 & 3 → 0101 & 0011 = 0001 → Result: 1

🔹 Bitwise OR (|) sets each bit to 1 if at least one of the corresponding bits is 1.
👉 Example: 5 | 3 → 0101 | 0011 = 0111 → Result: 7

🔹 Bitwise XOR (^) sets each bit to 1 only if the corresponding bits are different.
👉 Example: 5 ^ 3 → 0101 ^ 0011 = 0110 → Result: 6

🔹 Bitwise NOT (~) inverts all bits of an integer.
👉 Example: ~5 → ~0101 = ...1010 → Result: -6 (in two's complement)

🔹 Left Shift (<<) shifts bits to the left, multiplying the number by powers of 2.
👉 Example: 5 << 1 → 0101 << 1 = 1010 → Result: 10

🔹 Right Shift (>>) shifts bits to the right, dividing the number by powers of 2.
👉 Example: 5 >> 1 → 0101 >> 1 = 0010 → Result: 2

🔹 These operators are used within control structures like if, while, and switch to manipulate data efficiently.
🔹 Bitwise operations are especially useful in scenarios where multiple flags or states are stored compactly in a single variable.

🧠 Conclusion

Bitwise operators unlock a layer of programming precision that goes beyond standard arithmetic. Whether you're shifting bits or toggling flags, these operations empower efficient, low-level data handling. From optimizing performance to encoding logic with elegance bitwise mastery is a hidden superpower in every programmer’s toolkit.⚙️💡
